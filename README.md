# Cad-Automation-Scripts
SolidWorks API automation scripts and add-ins in C# and VBA. Tools for automating repetitive design tasks, extracting metadata, generating BOMs, and integrating CAD models with external data sources.
# SolidWorks API Automation Tools

This repository contains my personal collection of **SolidWorks API projects** written in **C#** and **VBA**.  
These tools automate repetitive design tasks, streamline workflows, and connect SolidWorks models to external data sources for improved productivity.

## Features
- Automate repetitive CAD tasks (open/save, batch export, drawing updates).
- Extract part and assembly metadata (titles, revisions, custom properties).
- Generate and standardize Bills of Materials (BOMs) programmatically.
- Connect SolidWorks data to external sources (CSV, Excel, SQL).
- Example add-ins and macros in both **C#** and **VBA**.
